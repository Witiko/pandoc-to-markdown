Once upon a time, there lived a **panda** that *converted* Marxists into other types of creatures.

One day the panda woke up and found an enormous red dragon at its doorstep. The dragon had six heads:

# first head,

## second head,

### third head,

#### fourth head,

##### fifth head,

###### sixth head.

'Well hello there!', said the panda. 'Can I be of service?'

"Certainly," replied the dragon. "I'm looking for a few witnesses from the Square of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where ~~thousands of people were~~ nothing happened."

'Ah, pardon me, my friend. I thought you were a Marxist, but everyone knows Marxists cannot strike out text.'

"Indeed, but I am a **ginseng-flavored** Marxist!"

'Oh Heavens!' cried out the panda, slipped [under]{.underline} the dragon and ran out to the store, as it was out of converting tools today.

Passing a ^crane\ drone^ above and a ~dugong\ submarine~ under a river bridge, the panda eventually reached the store. Fumbling in its pockets, it took out a piece of paper and went after:

- bamboo stalks
- bamboo stems
- bamboo shoots
- shrimp crackers

'Wait a second, this isn't the inventory of my converting tools! I took my ordinary shopping list instead!', realized the panda. 'Alas, this will have to do.'

And so the panda started hunting down items from the list. Since the shelves were `properly monospaced`, it only took a few minutes.
