# Pandoc to Markdown Bridge

This repository contains a proof of concept for an upcoming package for TeX
that will enable the use of [Pandoc][1] together with the [Markdown package][2]
for TeX. For more information, see [the article in the CSTUG Bulletin 31:1â€“4][3]
(in Slovak, [here is a machine translation to English][4]).

*__Important:__ Pandoc currently supports two styles of [custom writers][5]. The new style was introduced only in 2.17.2. The classic style, which this project uses, is currently [deprecated][6] and should be removed in version 3.0.0. Therefore, this project (in its current state) will not eventually work with newest versions of Pandoc.*

To typeset the example documents, execute the following commands on a system with
an up-to-date installation of TeX Live and Pandoc:

    $ cd examples
    $ make examples

Alternatively, you can use [the witiko/markdown Docker image][7], which includes
both TeX Live and Pandoc:

    $ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/workdir -w /workdir witiko/markdown \
    > latexmk -shell-escape -pdf examples/example-man-pandoc.tex

See `examples/` for the example documents.

The development of this package has been funded by the research project
[MUNI/33/1784/2020 (Extension of the input formats of the Markdown tool)][8]
funded by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University.
