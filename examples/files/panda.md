Once upon a time, there lived a **panda** that *converted* Marxists into other types of creatures.

One day the panda woke up and found an enormous red dragon at its doorstep. The dragon had six heads:

# first head,

## second head,

### third head,

#### fourth head,

##### fifth head,

###### sixth head.

"Well hello there!", said the panda. "Can I be of service?"

"Certainly," replied the dragon. "I'm looking for a few witnesses from the Square of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where ~~thousands of people were~~ nothing happened."

"Ah, pardon me, my friend. I thought you were a Marxist, but everyone knows Marxists cannot strike out text."

"Indeed, but I am a **ginseng-flavored** Marxist!"[^gfm]

"Oh Heavens!" cried out the panda, slipped [under]{.underline} the dragon and ran out to the store, as it was out of converting tools today.

[^gfm]: This was a pun on Github-flavored Markdown, which this document was in. Pandoc-flavored Markdown works better for this demonstration, so I later switched to that. Since then, I don't know how to make the pun work.

> Mencius said, "When a minister lives among calumniators, flatterers, and sycophants, though he may wish the State to be well governed, is it possible for it to be so?" (Mn. 6B.13)

Passing a ^crane\ drone^ above and a ~dugong\ submarine~ under a river bridge, the panda eventually reached the store. Fumbling in its pockets, it took out a piece of paper and went after:

- bamboo stalks
- bamboo stems
- bamboo shoots
- shrimp crackers

'Wait a second, this isn't the inventory of my converting tools! I took my ordinary shopping list instead! &\\^$#{%|}~\_!', sweared the panda. 'Alas, this will have to do.'

And so the panda started hunting down items from the list. Since the shelves were `properly monospaced`, it only took a few minutes.

```
{~~}  []][  #<>#  $^^%
}{}{  |__|  &><&  $^^%
```

Some of the shelves were very colorful and caught the panda's eye, but as it stared at them...

```lua
function CodeBlock(s, attr)
  local filename = meta.auxDir .. "/CodeBlock." .. codeBlocks
  local file = assert(io.open(filename, "w"))
  file:write(s)
  file:close()
  codeBlocks = codeBlocks + 1
  return "\\pandocCodeBlock{" .. filename .. "}{" .. attr.class .. "}"
end
```

...the shelves started staring back, which disoriented the panda a lot.

Eventually the panda grabbed all the weap- uh, snacks it wanted and headed back home.

| imposing and red.[^raw]

The panda felt very [small]{.smallcaps} in comparison, but it gathered all its courage and with a loud "Take this!", threw the bamboo stalks at the dragon with full force.

Without missing a beat, the dragon snatched the packet of stalks as if it were a baseball. "Wow, thanks a lot! Deep down I knew you're capable of sharing with others."

The panda was stupefied. "Weren't you going to, uh, eat me?"

"What? You? Nah, I'm vegan. Anyway, we're nationalizing your house. It's too big and you're driving up our country's Gini coefficient."

$$
G = \frac{\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \left| x_i - x_j \right|}}{\displaystyle{2 \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_j}} = \frac{\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \left| x_i - x_j \right|}}{\displaystyle{2n\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}} = \frac{\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \left| x_i - x_j \right|}}{\displaystyle{2 n^2 \bar{x}}}
$$

"I mean," the panda opined, "can't you just bring it back down by increasing the $2 n^2 \bar{x}$ in the denominator?"

"That's not how the math works. The sums in the numerator would increase as well."

"Oh... but I like my house."

"Sorry, pal. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs [see @becker1844; @blanc1851; later also @marx1875], as we say."
